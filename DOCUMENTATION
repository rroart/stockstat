For making simple stats and graphs

There are two phases, data acquisition and usage

The input format is
body: row*
row: id marketid name date indexvalue price currency period1 period2 period3 period4 period5

then run target/stockstat-input-0.3-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar with a param file of that format

Database:
Need to provide postgres with a database stockstat, and username/password stockstat/password.

Single interval days: (R mytableintervaldays)
Table days (R days): how many days to use for the graph or statistics
Table interval days (R mytableintervaldays): interval between days for above
Table top/bottom (R topbottom): number to show in top/bottom chart
